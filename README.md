# Making-A-Java-Game 🎮

> Watch me fail miserably at trying to make a Java game — (HOW DOES NOTCH DO THIS?!)

## ✅ Project Overview

This repository contains a simple Java game project written purely in Java.  
It is a personal experimentation project aimed at understanding how basic games are built — including game loops, rendering, input handling, and simple logic.

- **Language:** Java  
- **Dependencies:** None (pure Java)  
- **Purpose:** Learning and experimenting  
- **Status:** Work in progress

## 🛠️ Getting Started

### 1. Install Java
Make sure you have **Java JDK** installed (version 8+ is fine).

### 2. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/PrathyayPGM-ALT/Making-A-Java-Game.git
```
### 3. Open it in an IDE
- Use any Java-friendly IDE:

- IntelliJ IDEA

- Eclipse

- VS Code (with Java extensions)

### 4. Run the Game
Open the folder containing your main class (usually inside My_Java_Game)
Then run the main() method of the main file.

⚠️ Early project = bugs will be there. Laugh at them, fix them, learn from them.

### 📝 Features (so far)
- Basic game window setup

- Basic rendering

- Handling keyboard / mouse input (if implemented)

- Basic movement logic

- Foundation for a proper game loop

This is just the starting point — meant for learning and experimenting.

### Future Improvements / TODOs
- Add sprite rendering (images instead of default shapes)

- Add animations

- Enemy movement / AI

- Game states (menu, pause, game over)

- Scoring system

- Collision detection

- Sound effects

- Cleanup + refactoring

### Why This Exists
I wanted to learn how games work under the hood.
No Unity. No Godot. No fancy engines. Just pure Java and pain.
This project is a sandbox to break things, fix them, learn, and build something cooler over time.
